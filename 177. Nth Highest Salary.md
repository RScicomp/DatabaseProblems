# Finding the Nth Highest Salary in SQL

This document compares two different SQL approaches for finding the nth highest salary from a table.

## Time Complexity Analysis

### OFFSET Approach
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Table scan: O(n)
  - DISTINCT operation: O(n)
  - OFFSET operation: O(N) where N is the offset value
- **Why it matters**:
  - Linear scanning makes it efficient for single-pass operations
  - Performance primarily depends on table size
  - Memory usage is minimal as it only needs to track distinct values

### DENSE_RANK Approach
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Window function sorting: O(n log n)
  - Rank computation: O(n)
  - Final filtering: O(1)
- **Why it matters**:
  - Sorting overhead for all rows can be significant
  - Performance depends on total number of rows, not distinct values
  - Additional memory needed for sorting and rank computation

### Performance Impact Examples
- For a table with many duplicate salaries:
  - OFFSET approach: Linear scan O(n)
  - DENSE_RANK approach: Still requires O(n log n) as it must sort all rows
- For a table with mostly unique salaries:
  - OFFSET approach: Maintains linear O(n) performance
  - DENSE_RANK approach: O(n log n) due to sorting all rows

### Approach 1: Using OFFSET

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS TABLE (Salary INT) AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Input validation
    IF n < 1 THEN
        RETURN NULL;  -- Return null if n is invalid
    END IF;

    RETURN QUERY (
        SELECT DISTINCT e.salary
        FROM Employee e
        ORDER BY e.salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET n - 1
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Approach 2: Using DENSE_RANK

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS TABLE (Salary INT) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY (
        SELECT a.salary
        FROM (
            SELECT e.salary, 
                   DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY e.salary DESC) r 
            FROM Employee e
        ) a
        WHERE a.r = n
        LIMIT 1
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Important Considerations

1. **Function Syntax**
   - Uses PostgreSQL's specific `RETURNS TABLE` syntax
   - Requires `LANGUAGE plpgsql` specification
   - Uses `$$` for function body delimiter
   - Uses `RETURN QUERY` for returning result sets

2. **OFFSET vs DENSE_RANK Approach**
   - OFFSET approach:
     - Simpler to understand
     - Linear time complexity O(n)
     - Better for large datasets
     - Performance degrades with larger N values
   - DENSE_RANK approach:
     - More complex implementation
     - O(n log n) time complexity
     - Consistent performance regardless of N
     - Higher memory usage due to sorting

3. **NULL Handling**
   - Input validation important for OFFSET approach
   - DENSE_RANK approach naturally returns empty result for invalid N
   - Both return empty result set when no matching salary exists

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - OFFSET:
     - Single pass through data O(n)
     - Memory efficient as no sorting required
     - Performance depends on value of N
     - Better for large datasets when N is small
   - DENSE_RANK:
     - Requires sorting all rows O(n log n)
     - Higher memory overhead for sorting
     - Consistent performance for any N
     - Less efficient for large datasets

## Recommendation

- Use Approach 1 (OFFSET) for:
  - When optimal time complexity O(n) is crucial
  - Large datasets with many rows
  - When memory usage needs to be minimized
  - When N is relatively small compared to dataset size

- Use Approach 2 (DENSE_RANK) for:
  - When consistent performance regardless of N is needed
  - When you need to handle duplicate values elegantly
  - When you're already using window functions in your query
  - When the O(n log n) overhead is acceptable for your use case

The choice between these approaches often depends on:
1. Dataset size and characteristics
2. Value of N relative to dataset size
3. Frequency of function calls
4. Whether consistent performance or optimal worst-case performance is more important

## Note on NULL Values
Both approaches need to consider NULL handling in real-world applications. It's recommended to add NULL checks or use COALESCE when dealing with salary data that might contain NULL values.
