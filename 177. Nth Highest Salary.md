# Finding the Nth Highest Salary in SQL

This document compares two different SQL approaches for finding the nth highest salary from a table.

## Approach 1: Using OFFSET

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1;
```

### How it works
1. `DISTINCT` removes duplicate salary values
2. `ORDER BY Salary DESC` sorts salaries in descending order
3. `LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1` skips N-1 rows and returns the next row

### Time Complexity
- O(n log n) due to sorting operation
- Space Complexity: O(1) as it only needs to store one value

### Advantages
- Simple and intuitive implementation
- Works well for small to medium-sized datasets
- Easy to understand and maintain

### Disadvantages
- Performance may degrade with large datasets due to sorting
- OFFSET operation needs to scan through N-1 rows

## Approach 2: Using Subquery Count

```sql
SELECT Salary
FROM Employee e1
WHERE N-1 = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary
);
```

### How it works
1. For each salary in the outer query
2. Counts how many distinct salaries are greater than it
3. Returns the salary where exactly N-1 salaries are greater

### Time Complexity
- O(nÂ²) in worst case due to nested loop
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Advantages
- No explicit sorting required
- Can be more efficient for finding specific positions (like 2nd or 3rd highest)
- Works well with indexes on the Salary column

### Disadvantages
- More complex to understand
- May perform poorly on large datasets due to nested query
- Multiple table scans required

## Recommendation

- Use Approach 1 (OFFSET) for:
  - Small to medium-sized datasets
  - When code readability is a priority
  - When the data is already sorted or indexed

- Use Approach 2 (Subquery) for:
  - When you have good indexes on the Salary column
  - When you need to find salaries close to the top (small N)
  - When avoiding sorting operations is beneficial

## Note on NULL Values
Both approaches need to consider NULL handling in real-world applications. It's recommended to add NULL checks or use COALESCE when dealing with salary data that might contain NULL values.
